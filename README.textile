h1. Logback appender for ØMQ message transport layer

This project must be used with the "Logback":http://logback.qos.ch/ project in order to produce log messages over "ZeroMQ":http://www.zeromq.org/ messaging library.

This way, the application logs can be sent to remote systems / can be receive by remote systems.


h2. Installation

h3. Requirements

Before installing and using this appender with Logback, you need to install ZeroMQ Java Binding library (2.1) on your system. This binding uses native library to work. 

The "ZeroMQ":http//www.zeromq.org/ website is a great place to start installing the libraries, specially the "Java binding page":http://www.zeromq.org/bindings:java

If you want to develop or modify this plugin, I encourage you to read the "ØMQ - The Guide":http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all which is very well documented.

You must download slf4j-api.jar, logback-core.jar and logback-classic.jar on their respective project pages: SLF4J:"http://www.slf4j.org/" and "Logback:"http://logback.qos.ch/ .


h3. Installation

Put the following jar in the classpath of your Java application:

<pre>
slf4j-logback-zeromq-0.0.1.jar
</pre>

You must also put in the classpath the Java binding compiled for your system:

<pre>
jzmq-2.1.0.jar
</pre>

Finally, put the SLF4J and Logback jars in the classpath:

<pre>
slf4j-api-1.6.4.jar
logback-core-1.0.0.jar
logback-classic-1.0.0.jar
</pre>


h3. Configuration

The configuration of the ØMQ appender is done in the usual "Logback configuration file":http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html

The appender must be declared in the logback*.xml file:

<pre>
	<appender name="zeromq-bind" class="org.tlrx.logback.appender.ZMQSocketAppender">
		<!-- Define the ØMQ socket type -->
		<type>PUB</type>
		<!-- Only one of bind+connect must be declared -->
		<bind>tcp://*:9797</bind>
		<connect>tcp:localhost:9700</connect>
		<encoder>
			<!-- Message format -->
			<pattern>%-5level %logger{26} - %msg</pattern>
		</encoder>
	</appender>
</pre>

Where:

|_. Property            |_. Description|
| @<type>@              | Define the ØMQ socket type, can be: * PUB * SUB * REQ * XREQ Default is set to PUB |
| @<bind>@              | The ØMQ socket will connect to the given address using "bind()":http://api.zeromq.org/2-1:zmq-bind method.

Can be used only if socket is PUB or SUB type |
| @<connect>@           | The ØMQ socket will connect to the given address using "connect()":http://api.zeromq.org/2-1:zmq-connect method  |
| @<pattern>@		| The pattern defines the format of the ØMQ message that will be sent by the appender.

The format used the same PatternLayout of the default Logback ConsoleAppender: http://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html#ClassicPatternLayout|
